Basic rules of the language:
Semi colons mark the end of a statement and so separating code by lines is not actually necessary although obviously more readable.
Indenting is not necessary although once again makes it easier to read.
Any characters can be used in variable names as long as it works (idk what ill do if it doesn't)
Code can technically be separated over multiple lines as long as spacing and code itself is correct (once again idk why you'd do this).




Operators:
clear: Takes only one operand input, will check to see if the variable exists, if so it will reset its value to 0, if not it will create a new variable with value 0.
  Example - clear VAR1;
incr: Takes only one operand input, if the variable exists it will increment its value by 1.
  Example - incr VAR1;
decr: Takes only one operand input, if the variable exists it will decrement its value by 1.
  Example - decr VAR1;
endwhile: Declares the end of a while loop.
endif: Declares the end of an if statement

Comments:
// is used to denote the start of a comment, this will comment the line
  Example clear VAR1; //This is a comment
